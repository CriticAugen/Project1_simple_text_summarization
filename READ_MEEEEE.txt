open main.py
in url paste the wiki page you want to summarize
in bot.summarize(max_len,total_sentence)
max_length denotes the words in a sentence... you can configure it as you want

total_sentence denotes the line in summary

so if you chosse not.summary(10,20)
if will produce a summary where summary will have 20 lines and each line will have
less than or equal to 10 words.

if you want best summary... then i recommend (25,15). (of course it is for wiki)
(it can change as per pages)
*just a note that if you want to summarize a para or a huge document make sure
what your requirements are, do you need 10 lines of summary or 25...
do you need small sentences of 15 words or is that document is a thesis with 25+ words in sentence
